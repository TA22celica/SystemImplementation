# INFO-C451-System_Implementation
 
This is an ecommerce website - IU Guitar Shop - and the primary goal is to add customer feedback/survey functionality. In this first pass, the customer feedback has been implemented on each of the product pages as stars and comments. This is placed into the mysql database and displayed for customers and admins to see.

## Getting Started:

Create mysql db called "test" and run project.sql as a query. 
This will allow the instantiation of all db-dependent php files. 

## Roadmap

In future iterations, there will be more survey functionality added and a survey/feedback dashboard for admin use to analyze product sentiment.
